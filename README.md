## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯

* How might we minimize food wastage in the airline industry caused by overestimation, passenger rejection, and dissatisfaction with limited dietary options?
* How might we cater to sudden changes in passengers' dietary requirements efficiently, considering instances where preferences change or are not specified at the time of booking?
* How might we improve the overall passenger experience, especially in economy class, by allowing them to choose and customize their meals ahead of the flight, reducing uncertainty and enhancing satisfaction?

## Project Description 🤯

A website post-booking that works with any airline website (e.g., Tripme) where passengers pick their meals, earning airline points. This not only cuts wastage by tailoring catering needs but also lets users craft their ideal culinary journey on long/International flights. 

The Information Architecture - 
1. Post-Booking Notification:
   - After booking a flight, a pop-up appears, prompting users to create their meal plan and earn points.

2. Meal Planning Page:
   - Clicking the button leads users to a dedicated page featuring a menu of in-flight meal options.
  
3. Customization and Preferences:
   - Users can select their preferred meals, opt out if not interested, and include dietary preferences to enhance health safety and minimize wastage.

4. Integration with Trip Information:
   - The chosen meal plan seamlessly integrates with the users' trip details.

5. Editable Until 24 Hours Before Flight:
   - Users can edit their meal choices and preferences until 24 hours before the scheduled flight.
